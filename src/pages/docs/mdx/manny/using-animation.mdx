# Using Animation

manny is using the <a href="https://www.mixamo.com" target="_blank">mixamo</a> rig 
and supports loading animations in .fbx or .glb format. To use your own animations,
define them in the `paths` property of `animationOptions` with the animation name
and url as key/value pairs.

<Code language="js">
{`const Manny = () => {
  const mannyObj = manny({
    animationOptions: {
      active: 'idle',
      paths: {
        idle: 'https://yourhost.com/animations/idle.fbx',
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <group position={[0, -90, 0]}>
      <primitive object={mannyObj} dispose={null} />
    </group>
  );
}`}

</Code>

If no `animationOptions` are provided, the returned manny object will not
have an animation mixer and will be in a static default pose with arms resting
at the side, useful if using custom animation state logic.

## Loading Animations Lazily

Defining all possible animations in `paths` might make your manny bloated and slow to
load, so to avoid this you can include just the `paths` you want to load, and manny
will cache any loaded animations after rendering.

<Code language="js">
{`const paths = { ... };

const Manny = ({ animation }) => {
  const mannyObj = manny({
    animationOptions: {
      active: animation,
      paths: {
        [animation]: paths[animation],
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <group position={[0, -90, 0]}>
      <primitive object={mannyObj} dispose={null} />
    </group>
  );
}`}
</Code>
